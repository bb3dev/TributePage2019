                <h3 id="headline">There is nothing more important than family.</h3>
                <li><strong>First and Foremost: </strong>To my parents... My father and mother have raised me to be
                    honest and sculpted me to be a generous young adult. Being a responsible parent is a heroic deed,
                    and I appreciate their gracious effort they
                    put forth when .</li>
                <li><strong>I am my brothers' keeper: </strong>To my brothers... Being an older brother has been a great
                    learning experience for me and my younger siblings. They helped me develop leadership skills, showed
                    me the value of friendship, and the importance of loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>My home away from Home: </strong>To the Fosters... The Foster family showed me unconditional
                    love and treated me as if I were one of them. I am extremely grateful to be apart of their family.
                </li>
                <li><strong>My queen: </strong>To my love... Vanessa has been the person who I can count on at any time.
                    She started as a my friend, she became my best friend, and now she is soon to be my wife. There are
                    not enough words to express my love and appreciation for her.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Long time no see: </strong>To my friends and former teammates... The friendships and bonds I
                    have made with you all has helped shaped me to become the person I am today. Although it has been a
                    while since we last spoke, I have not forgotten about you. The memories we made will last a
                    lifetime, and I await the day we converse again.</li>
